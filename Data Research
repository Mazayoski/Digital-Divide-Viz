Project idea 1- internet accesibility to race density by county
Project idea 2- internet by provider national map
Project idea 3- average income to housing prices by race *
Average household income- https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=702bd623b3614b4184f94947c18b75c8
median home value - https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=85bf74bd2b6243ac8ce2556028cd592f

Have a map of US where counties are interactive, can press on a county and it will have the statistics within of each race with average income, home value, and density.
tool extracts this data(can specify by which race) to compare in a xlsx file where the stats are listed. each stat will be red or green based on which is greater.
can also list % difference as well as numerical difference 

presntation idea: slide show with extent of us, then to state, then to particuluar county, show county attribute table, then show extract tool(include different options)
then show the pulled file with different statistics highlighting the utility of the tool

For data extracton- map is going to show the US by race including state and county. Extract all race data, and to the data avg income and home price by race. May need to make
new data source that is a combination of them all
